# Uncensored Frontend

If your wallet does not support [Uncensored SDK](../uncensored-sdk/overview.md), you can use the Uncensored Frontend to force include your transactions.

**NOTE: Only Optimism Chains are supported right now**

You can try out the Uncensored Frontend [here](https://rollup-uncensored.vercel.app/).

## How to use

- Get the transaction data - check out the [Send Transaction](send-transaction.md) section.
- If the network you are on does not show up in the dropdown - check out the [Custom Network](custom-network.md) section.
- If you want to see the transaction history - check out the [Transaction History](transaction-history.md) section.
