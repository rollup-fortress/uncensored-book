# Uncensored Frontend - Custom Network

If you don't find the chain you want on the Uncensored Frontend, you can add it as a custom network.

**NOTE: Only Optimism Stack Chains are supported right now**

After you click the chain button, you will see a dropdown menu of supported chains. Click `Add Network` to add a custom network. In the `Add Network` modal, you need to fill in the following fields:

- `Network Name`: The name of the chain you want to add.
- `Chain ID`: The chain ID of the chain you want to add.
- `Portal Proxy Address`: The address of the L1 (Optimism Portal) contract to make the force inclusion request.
- `RPC URL`: The RPC URL of the chain you want to add.

After you fill in the fields, click `Add Network` to add the custom network.
