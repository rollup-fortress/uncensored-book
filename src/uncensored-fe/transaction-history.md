# Uncensored Frontend - Transaction History

You can view your force inclusion transaction history on the top right corner of the Uncensored Frontend.

For one force inclusion, you will see a pair of one L1 transaction and one L2 transaction. L1 transaction is the transaction that you sent on the L1 chain to make the force inclusion request, and L2 transaction is the transaction that will be included and executed on the L2 chain.
