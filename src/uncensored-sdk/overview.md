# Uncensored SDK

We have test scripts that use the SDK to make force inclusion requests on testnets. For now, please refer to the [scripts](https://github.com/rollup-fortress/uncensored/tree/master/tests) on how to use the SDK. It's actually very simple!

You can also check out the Rabby Wallet modifiication we made to support the force inclusion feature. [Here](https://github.com/NIC619/Rabby/pull/1) is the link to the code change.

**NOTE: Only Optimism Stack Chains are supported right now**
